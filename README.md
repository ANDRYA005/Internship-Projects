# Internship-Projects

Unfortunately, due to an NDA, I am unable to upload the code for the projects that were completed during my internship at an AI company in Cape Town.
However, I will briefly outline the tools that were used.

1. Built a **python app** using a combination of Bokeh, Panel, Param and HoloViews. Besides for basic functionality (which cannot be disclosed), the app had to be able to store the interaction of the user and save it locally in JSON files. We presented the app to the whole company, and they seemed impressed with our work.

2. Made a video demo using OpenCV of **object tracking**, utilizing homography for accurate frame-by-frame movements.

3. Explored and made use of the **GitHub API** in order to test the possibilities of automating some of the interactions that the team had with GitHub.

Each of the projects mentioned above were completed to a high standard.
